Many problems will have additional questions to answer, or will ask for a record of the terminal showing the output when the program is run with various arguements.  These answers can be given either in block comments in the prologue of the corresponding assignment, or in clearly labeled text files.  The terminal output should contain some information on the username and machine you are running on (this will often be in the command prompt).\n",

You should do this by adding any new or modified files using \"git add\", and then finalizing changes using \"git commit\".  Remember that \"git status\" will give you information on which files in your repository. have been changed.  Remember to add short, but useful comments when performing a commit. When you are finished with the exercise, push the current status of your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub using the command \"git push -u\". You are encouraged to push your local files to the remote repository periodically before you are done, and certainly well before the deadline, if possible."

    "The Lotka–Volterra equations are a mathematical model of predator–prey interactions between biological species. Let two variables $x$ and $y$ be proportional to the size of the populations of two species, traditionally called “rabbits” (the prey) and “foxes” (the predators). You could think of $x$ and $y$ as being the population in thousands, say, so that x = 2 means there are 2000 rabbits. Strictly the only allowed values of $x$ and $y$ would then be multiples of 0.001, since you can only have whole numbers of rabbits or foxes. But 0.001 is a pretty close spacing of values, so it’s a decent approximation to treat $x$ and $y$ as continuous real numbers so long as neither gets very close to zero."

Have the program make a graph showing both $x$ and $y$ as a function of time on the same axes from $t = 0$ to $t = 30$. (Hint: Notice that the differential equations in this case do not depend explicitly on time $t$—in vector notation, the right-hand side of each equation is a function `f(r)` with no t dependence. You may nonetheless find it convenient to define a Python function `f(r,t)` including the time variable, so that your program takes the same form as programs given chapter 8. You don’t have to do it that way, but it can avoid some confusion. Several of the following exercises have a similar lack of explicit time-dependence.)"

The spring constant, instead of being constant as in a simple harmonic oscillator, could have a quadratic dependence. That is, $k$ would be proportional to $x^2$ giving the nonlinear equation:\n",
