    "For each problem, you will write one or more python programs.  These programs should follow the Python coding and formatting conventions outlined for the course.  Many problems will have additional questions to answer, or will ask for a record of the terminal showing the output when the program is run with various arguements.  These answers can be given either in block comments in the prologue of the corresponding assignment, or in clearly labeled text files.  The terminal output should contain some information on the username and machine you are running on (this will often be in the command prompt).\n",

    "You will be evaluated based on the files contained in your remote GitHub repository at the due date.  You should and commit all the files you created to your local repository on a regular basis. You should do this by adding any new or modified files using \"git add\", and then finalizing changes using \"git commit\".  Remember that \"git status\" will give you information on which files in your repository. have been changed.  Remember to add short, but useful comments when performing a commit. When you are finished with the exercise, push the current status of your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub using the command \"git push -u\". You are encouraged to push your local files to the remote repository periodically before you are done, and certainly well before the deadline, if possible."

    "In condensed matter physics the Madelung constant gives the total electric potential felt by an atom in a solid. It depends on the charges on the other atoms nearby and their locations.

The sodium chloride crystal has atoms arranged on a cubic lattice, but with alternating sodium and chlorine atoms, the sodium ones having a single positive charge $+e$ and the chlorine ones a single negative charge $-e$,\n", 
    "where $e$ is the charge on the electron. If we label each position on the lattice by three integer coordinates $(i, j, k)$, then the sodium atoms fall at positions where $i + j + k$ is even, and the chlorine atoms at positions where $i + j + k$ is odd. "
