Part A


r = h + R            #radius from CM equal to earthradius+heightabovesurface

GMm/r^2 = mv^2/r     #Gravitational force equal to centripetal force
v = sqrt(GM/r)       #rearrange

2pi*r = vt           #orbit length equals velocity (in phi) * period
v = 2pi*r/t

2pi*r/t = sqrt(GM/r)  #combining first two equations
r = (GMt^2 / (4pi^2))^(1/3)
h = (GMt^2 / (4pi^2))^(1/3) - R

Hello user, please enter a desired period in seconds:2700
The desired altitude of a satellite with period 2700 seconds is : -2.18e+06 mete

My conclusion is that a satellite cannot have  period as low as 2700s or else it would require it to be below the earths surface.




Part D

By definition, a sidereal day is the time it takes Earth to make a full rotational relative to the sun. A geosynchronous satellite would have to match this period in order to remain in phase.
