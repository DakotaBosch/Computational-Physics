PART B
z = 1/2 when x = c. 
x = 1-a when the integrand is at a maximum... therefore c = 1-a.

Integrand = x^(a-1)*e^-x
	      = e^((a-1)*lnx)*e^-x
		  = e^((a-1)*lnx-x)
this new expression doesn't involve multiplication between a very large and a very small number.

z=x/(c+x)
z*(c+x) = x
zc = x-xz
zc = x(1-z)
x=zc/(1-z)

=> Integrand = e^((a-1)*ln(z*c/(1-z)))-(z*c/(1-z)))
