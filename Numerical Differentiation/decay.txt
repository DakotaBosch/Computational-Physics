PARTB
In the cases of T=0.1 and 0.01 the initial value, where time =0, does not return N(initial). I instead hardcoded the first element of each array to equal N(initial).





PARTC

Nd is proportional to Td. 
When Tp>>Td, Nd begins at zero and makes a very small jump over the first infitesimal time period and then exponentially decays
When Tp ~ Td, Nd begins at zero and make a jump to the value of Np over a infinitesimal time period and then exponentially decays
When Tp <<Td, Nd begins at zero and makes a jump much larger than Np over an infinitesimal time period and then exponentailly decays
