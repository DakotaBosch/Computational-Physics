    "For each problem, you will write one or more python programs.  These programs should follow the Python coding and formatting conventions outlined for the course.  Many problems will have additional questions to answer, or will ask for a record of the terminal showing the output when the program is run with various arguements.  These answers can be given either in block comments in the prologue of the corresponding assignment, or in clearly labeled text files.  The terminal output should contain some information on the username and machine you are running on (this will often be in the command prompt).\n",

    "You will be evaluated based on the files contained in your remote GitHub repository at the due date.  You should and commit all the files you created to your local repository on a regular basis. You should do this by adding any new or modified files using \"git add\", and then finalizing changes using \"git commit\".  Remember that \"git status\" will give you information on which files in your repository. have been changed.  Remember to add short, but useful comments when performing a commit. When you are finished with the exercise, push the current status of your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub using the command \"git push -u\". You are encouraged to push your local files to the remote repository periodically before you are done, and certainly well before the deadline, if possible."

    "(b) We can use these ideas to solve many problems involving diffusion or the behavior of other particles in a dense medium.  Let us consider the movement of photons in the sun.  These photons frequently collide and scatter off of the charged particles that comprise the plasma in the sun. Note that the average distance between collisions, or the \"mean free path\", is $\\ell=1$ cm.  First, modify your program from part (a) to have a lattice of L = 10001, and to run for N = 100000 steps.  Then, calculate the distance $D$ from the starting point to the final position of the particle, assuming the spacing between each lattice position is 1 cm.  Now, run this simulation for 1000 particles, and calculate the average of the distance squared $\\langle D^2 \\rangle$ for these particles (Note that we expect that average of D to be $\\langle D \\rangle = 0$). The \"root-mean-square\" distance traveled is related to the number of steps by $D_\\mathrm{rms} = \\sqrt{N} \\ell$.  We can then determine the relationship between the number of steps and $D$ (this is more useful for systems with more complicated behavior!).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate a couple more interesting quantities.  From our definition of $D_\\mathrm{rms}$, how many steps on average will the photon need to escape the Sun, i.e. for $D_\\mathrm{rms} = 696,340$ km (the radius of the sun), assuming  $\\ell=1$ cm.  How many years will this take, assuming that the photon is moving at the speed of light between scatters?"
